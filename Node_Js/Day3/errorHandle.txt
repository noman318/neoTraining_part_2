    There are 3 types of Error
        1. Syntax Error
        2. Runtime Error
        3. Logical Error (we Use Debugging for this)

1. Error Object in Js

const error = new Error("An error message")

It has an error.stack field that gives you a stack trace showing where the error came from.
It also lists all functions that were called before the error occurred.
The error.stack field is optimal to use while debugging as it prints the error.message as well.

2. Traditional Try Catch method 
function init() {
    try {
        doAthing();
    } catch(e) {
        console.log(e);
        // [Error: Uh oh!]
    }
}
3. Trace method
    console.log(error.stack)
    
    it gives provides information of the whole stack trace where Error has occurred. 
    It basically finds the root cause and system on which Error occurred.

4. Custom Middleware 

    Creating a custom middleware to handle error 
    For example: Admin middleware and LoggedIn user middleware

5. Using Third Party packages for Log Management

    To do this, you should use loggers like winston and morgan. 
    Additionally, you can add winston-logsene to send the logs to Sematext right away.
    File in the loggers directory and add morgan and morgan-json to print out access logs.
    const morgan = require('morgan')
    const json = require('morgan-json')
    const format = json({
    method: ':method',
    url: ':url',
    status: ':status',
    contentLength: ':res[content-length]',
    responseTime: ':response-time'
    })

6. StatusCode in HTTP request
    Successful responses (200 – 299)
    Redirection messages (300 – 399)
    Client error responses (400 – 499)
    Server error responses (500 – 599)
